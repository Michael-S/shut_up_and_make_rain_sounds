# shutupandmakerainsounds

An simple project to make rain sounds.


Licensed under the MIT License, see LICENSE file for details.


Built with Flutter ( https://flutter.dev/ ) and the Dart audioplayers package
( https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers ) which is itself licensed under MIT.

Included audio file was from Wikipedia and in the public domain, originally in OGG
format and I used ffmpeg to convert it to mp3.

A web demo of the app (though I'm not sure how long it will stay available) is at
